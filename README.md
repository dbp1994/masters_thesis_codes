# Codes for my M.Tech (Research) thesis

## Update (December 2022)
> All the codes have been shifted to [HERE])(https://github.com/dbp1994/bare-wacv-2023) for ```BARE``` and [HERE]() for the ```memorization_and_overparam``` work. If you have any questions about the codes or my work, please reach out to me here or on Twitter (@dbp_patel_1994).


## _BARE_
> Contains codes corresponding to the paper [_Adaptive Sample Selection for Robust Learning under Label Noise_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15292) which corresponds to [Ch-3 of my master's thesis](https://dbp1994.github.io/files/deep-patel-iisc-masters-thesis_compressed.pdf). This work has been accepted at [WACV 2023](https://wacv2023.thecvf.com/home).

## memorization_and_overparam
> Contains codes corresponding to the paper [_Memorization in Deep Neural Networks: Does the Loss Function Matter?_](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-75765-6_11) which corresponds to [Ch-4 of my master's thesis](https://dbp1994.github.io/files/deep-patel-iisc-masters-thesis_compressed.pdf). This work was published in PAKDD 2021.
