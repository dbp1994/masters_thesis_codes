> This folder will contain codes for the paper _[Adaptive Sample Selection for Robust Learning under Label Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15292)_. 

P.S: This work correspnds to [_Chapter 3 of my master's thesis_](https://dbp1994.github.io/files/deep-patel-iisc-masters-thesis_compressed.pdf).


> Final version of the codes for the proposed algorithm and baselines will be uploaded soon. Till then, refer to the function `weighted_CCE` in `losses.py` for an implementation of BARE algorithm with CCE loss. If you have any questions, please reach out to me here or on Twitter (@dbp_patel_1994).
